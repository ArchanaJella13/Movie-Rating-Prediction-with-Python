# Movie Rating Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts movie ratings based on user and movie features using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains user ratings, movie details, and additional metadata for training predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies) and contains:


## Project Workflow
1. **Data Exploration** – Analyze and visualize movie ratings, genres, and trends.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing data, feature engineering, and encoding.
3. **Model Training** – Train regression and recommendation models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.).
4. **Evaluation & Prediction** – Use RMSE, MAE, and other metrics to evaluate performance.

## Installation
To set up this project on your local system:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Rating-Prediction.git
cd Movie-Rating-Prediction
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook to explore and train models:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
## Dependencies
Install the following Python libraries before running the project:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter
To install all dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Run `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb` to explore the dataset.
- Run `notebooks/model_training.ipynb` to preprocess data and train models.
- Final predictions are saved in `results/predictions.csv`.

## Results
- The best-performing model achieves an RMSE of **XX**.
- Feature importance analysis indicates that **user preferences, genres, and past ratings** significantly influence predictions.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, enhance the model, or add new features.
